Andreas Abel PhD thesis

Interesting thoughts:
- Related work section of Coquand, Dybjer: Intuitionistic model constructions and normalization proofs
- Introduction of Dybjer, Filinski: Normalization and partial evaluation
- Andr√°s MSc, sec. 4.4

Remember:
- purpose of MSc thesis is not to make a big research contribution
- it is already nice to compare proofs and provide explanations
- the process of writing the thesis and what you learn on the way is more important than the outcome
- it showcases a bunch of stuff that I know and understand even if it is not interesting for researchers in the field
- don't have to aim for the perfect mathematical framework/presentation (but would be useful and nice)

Methodology
- focus on structure: definitions and main theorems
- fill in definitions
- identify lemmas
- write proofs
- highlight key points

TODO:
content:
- optional: add new requirements for NbE and prove them
- optional: add categorical proof of extensional normalization
- optional: discuss proofs using internal language of presheaf topos
- check literature for proof that gluing category is cartesian closed (Crole 1994, Taylor 1999, Johnstone 2002)

notation:
- A,B,C for types instead of \sigma,\tau,\chi in substitution calculus
- singleton contexts, term as substitution
- context extension, substitution extension for syntax and scwf
- types, terms, and substitutions for syntax and scwf
- singleton substitution, lifted substitution
- components of an scwf morphism
- canonical interpretation
- what to call \FSub?
- resolve confusion of substitution, singleton lists and equivalence classes
- use different fonts?

editing:
- check mathematical content
- check punctuation, spelling, grammar
- check punctuation in clauses ending with a diagram/equation
- a/an scwf?
- remove commands, replace them with informative sentences with a subject (e.g. see, compare)
- what to call lemma, proposition, theorem?
- replace notation environments with definition environments?
- what to put into an environment, and what to put as flowing text?

final touches:
- check line breaks inside formulas
- check overflowing lines
- arrangement of rules/equations in figures
- placement of figures

- ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted) lists?
- insert line break at the beginning of environment if the content is an enumeration
- include horizontal line above an axiom?
- titles for definitions/theorems
- remove/add notation (and terminology) paragraph titles?
- names of rules?

- change order of arguments for \typedtm
- always have author names before/in references?
- tidy up references
- tidy up labels
